## Build & Flash

### Prerequisites

- [ESP-IDF v5.0+](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/)
- USB-to-UART cable or ESP32 devkit USB
- MQTT broker (Mosquitto, Home Assistant, or HiveMQ)

### Configuration

Edit `main/config.h` before building:

```c
#define WIFI_SSID       "YOUR_WIFI_SSID"
#define WIFI_PASSWORD   "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD"
#define MQTT_BROKER_URI "mqtt://192.168.1.100:1883"
```

Optional: change the topic prefix
```c
#define MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX "home/livingroom"
```

### Build Commands

```bash
cd home_automation_c
idf.py set-target esp32
idf.py build
idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 flash monitor
```

Replace `/dev/ttyUSB0` with your actual serial port (Windows: `COM3`, macOS: `/dev/cu.usbserial-*`).

## MQTT Topics

### Topics the ESP32 Publishes To

| Topic | Payload | Retained | When |
|-------|---------|----------|------|
| `home/livingroom/relay1` | `ON` or `OFF` | Yes | Relay 1 changes |
| `home/livingroom/relay2` | `ON` or `OFF` | Yes | Relay 2 changes |
| `home/livingroom/relay3` | `ON` or `OFF` | Yes | Relay 3 changes |
| `home/livingroom/relay4` | `ON` or `OFF` | Yes | Relay 4 changes |
| `home/livingroom/status` | `{"temperature":25.0,"humidity":50.0}` | No | Every 30 seconds |
| `home/livingroom/availability` | `online` | Yes | On connect |
| `home/livingroom/availability` | `offline` | Yes | On disconnect (LWT) |

### Topics the ESP32 Subscribes To

| Topic | Payload | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `home/livingroom/relay1` | `ON` / `OFF` / `TOGGLE` | Control relay 1 |
| `home/livingroom/relay2` | `ON` / `OFF` / `TOGGLE` | Control relay 2 |
| `home/livingroom/relay3` | `ON` / `OFF` / `TOGGLE` | Control relay 3 |
| `home/livingroom/relay4` | `ON` / `OFF` / `TOGGLE` | Control relay 4 |
| `home/livingroom/all` | `ON` / `OFF` | Group control |

### Home Assistant Configuration

```yaml
mqtt:
  switch:
    - name: "Living Room Relay 1"
      state_topic: "home/livingroom/relay1"
      command_topic: "home/livingroom/relay1"
      payload_on: "ON"
      payload_off: "OFF"
      state_on: "ON"
      state_off: "OFF"
      availability_topic: "home/livingroom/availability"
      payload_available: "online"
      payload_not_available: "offline"
```

## How It Works

### Physical Switch Control

1. Press wall switch → GPIO pin pulled to **GND** (LOW)
2. `switch_scan()` detects change after 50ms debounce
3. Measures press duration:
   - **< 1 second**: sends toggle event → relay toggles → MQTT publishes new state
   - **> 1 second**: sends long-press event → **all relays OFF** → MQTT publishes all states
4. Status LED matches relay state instantly

### Remote Control (MQTT)

1. Send `ON` to `home/livingroom/relay1`
2. ESP32 receives message in `mqtt_event_handler()`
3. Calls registered `relay_cmd_cb()` → `relay_set(RELAY_1, true)`
4. Relay coil energizes, LED lights up
5. ESP32 publishes `ON` back to confirm

### Safety Features

| Feature | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| Max concurrent | Only 3 relays can be ON at once; 4th request is blocked |
| Thermal shutdown | Auto all-off if internal temp > 75°C |
| Auto reconnect | WiFi and MQTT reconnect automatically if lost |
| Buzzer feedback | Short beep on toggle, long beep on all-off |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Relays not clicking | Wrong GPIO pin mapping | Check transistor base wiring matches `config.h` |
| Switch does nothing | Missing pull-up resistor | Add 10kΩ between GPIO and 3.3V |
| MQTT not connecting | Wrong broker IP or credentials | Update `config.h` and reflash |
| WiFi keeps disconnecting | Weak signal | Move router closer or add external antenna |
| All relays ON at boot | Boot pin conflict | Avoid GPIO12 (strapping pin) for relays |
| Status LED always on | GPIO2 used as relay | Use GPIO2 only for status LED |
| Buzzer silent | Wrong polarity | Buzzer must be active-high type |
| Random relay toggles | EMI on long wires | Add 100nF capacitor at switch terminals |

### Serial Debug

Monitor the UART output to see real-time events:

```
I (1234) HA_MAIN: Relay1 -> ON
I (2345) HA_MAIN: Sensor: T=25.0C  H=50.0%
I (3456) WIFI: retry
I (4567) HA_MAIN: Switch1 toggle -> Relay1 OFF
```
